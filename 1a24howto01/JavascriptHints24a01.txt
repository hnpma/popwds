Each browser has its own engine for running JavaScript. JavaScript that 
is run in the browser is called 'client-side' JavaScript. Firefox runs
JavaScript on its browser using an engine called Spider Monkey to
run the client-side JavaScript. Each browser may handle HTML, CSS or
JavaScript differently because each browser uses its own engine.
A good resource to check browser usability of any JavaScript,HTML or
CSS is the website named 'Can I use'.

The <script>  element’s purpose is to include JavaScript into the web page.The <script>  tag can contain JavaScript code inside of it (inline JavaScript) or reference an external JavaScript file.
    <script>
        // JavaScript code goes here!
        console.log("Hello from inside the web page!");
    </script>

Event-driven is a programming pattern where the flow of the program is determined by a series of events. JavaScript uses events to handle user interaction and make web pages dynamic. JavaScript also uses events to know when the state of the web page components change.
